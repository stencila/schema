# What? A Makefile for running high level development tasks. For finer
# grained tasks see `package.json` and use `npm run <task>`.
#
# Why? Because Makefiles provide a common entry point for developers
# that are independent of the language and tooling used. In just
# about all our repos you can run `make setup` to get a dev setup
# and `cat Makefile` to quickly understand what to do next. Regardless
# or whether it's a Typescript, Python or R project.

## Notes

1.  Use the `about` property to define the item that a comment is on and `commentAspect` to point to a specific part of aspect of that item. The `content` property should be used for the structured content of the comment, in preference to the schema.org `text` property (which is expected to be plain text). Replies to a comment can be added to its `comments` property or have their `parentItem` set to the parent comment.
2.  **maintainers** : A maintainer of a Dataset, SoftwareApplication, or other CreativeWork. A maintainer is a Person or Organization that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on "upstream" sources. When maintainer is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a Dataset, it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The isBasedOn property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work.
3.  **description** : Allows for the description to be an array of nodes (e.g. an array of inline content, or a couple of paragraphs), or a string. The `minItems` restriction avoids a string being coerced into an array with a single string item.
4.  **dateAccepted** : This is not yet a schema.org property but the term is used [in Dublin Core](http://purl.org/dc/terms/dateAccepted).
5.  **commentAspect** : This propery is analagous to the `reviewAspect` property of the `reviewAspect` type. It is a string to allow flexibility in how the aspect is expressed depending on the item e.g "technique", for a comment on a painting, or "some_code.py#L10-L20" for a comment on a software code repository.
6.  **identifiers** : Some identifiers have specific properties e.g the `issn` property for the `Periodical` type. These should be used in preference to this property which is intended for identifiers that do not yet have a specific property. Identifiers can be represented as strings, but using a `PropertyValue` will usually be better because it allows for `propertyID` (i.e. the type of identifier).
7.  **title** : Allows for the title to include inline content (e.g `Strong`, `Math`) or a string. The title can not be block content e.g `Paragraph`. The `minItems` restriction avoids a string being coerced into an array with a single string item.
8.  **version** : In this case `string` is listed as an alternative before `number` to avoid semantic version numbers e.g. `1.0` being parsed, and subsequently encoded, as `1` thereby resulting in loss of information.
9.  **about** : Consistent with <https://schema.org/about>, this property allows for linking to one of more `Thing` nodes. This could for example include a `Person` (e.g for a bibliography) or a `DefinedTerm` (e.g. for subject areas the creative work relates to).
10. **fundedBy** : This follows the proposal [here](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2258) for a property that is the reverse of `fundedItems`. It is an any because a `CreativeWork` may have been funded through more than one `Grant`.
